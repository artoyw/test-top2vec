ChatGPT-4: The term ""Copernican fallacy"" does not refer to a widely recognized or well-established concept in philosophy or any other field. However, it seems to derive its name from the Copernican Revolution, which was a paradigm shift in the 16th century led by astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus. Copernicus proposed that the Earth and other planets revolve around the Sun, challenging the long-held belief in the geocentric model, which posited that the Earth was the center of the universe.

If one were to speculate on the meaning of ""Copernican fallacy,"" it could be interpreted as a fallacy where someone incorrectly assumes that they or their beliefs are central or essential to a particular situation, when in fact they are not. This would be a metaphorical extension of the shift from the geocentric to the heliocentric model. However, as mentioned earlier, the term ""Copernican fallacy"" is not widely recognized or used, so its interpretation may vary depending on the context.""

…Good enough.

**TL;DR**  


It's not GPT-4 failing to make the mark, we are missing it. What we are looking for in GPT-4 is not there because it is missing the mark; it is not there because the things (the ones you were also not successful in defining to yourself about yourself in the first place) do not exist—says someone who has a clue about human cognition to address the questions that for the few exceptions among those who develop it and a handful of philosophers and physicists.  
\-------------------------------------------------------

I know you're pissed, that is intentional for our civilizational egotistic self-image starring in disbelief as we drools and go extinct in the snap of an eye. But make sure you only downvote once you read this—or just move on, and swallow your pride.  
\------------------------------------------------------

At the end of reading this, you will either accept GPT-4 is what you didn't want to believe it is (I will not define it further because you weren't successful at doing that either), or you will try to argue that conservation of energy is incomplete or otherwise, potentially fundamentally flawed.

About me: I've always been a misfit; entered academia in a prominent faculty of philosophy on a university in Europe without reading a single book on academically recognized or bs (you know who you are) philosophy. In the first weeks, the faculty head gave out the task that the years' class write analyses of art of their own choice. I was the last one to file, late by days, and laid a brief analytical history of individual music philosophy in light of the non-opera work of Bobby McFerrin pretty much fathering multi-tonal beatboxing in light of the growing prevalence of loop pads. Fast forward 2 semesters, a conference erupts into a massive fight between some of the most prominent philosophers of Europe at the time, and my contribution to the debate as the only student to raise to speak at the time concludes the debacle, and renders it to an acceptable finding to all those at interest. The PhD's of the organizing school simply thought I was the Oxford-invitee, one of the speakers only to holler at me by the name going forward at the age 21. simply  I know, you're pissed, I'm a douchebag, and a showoff. Maybe so. But I needed to put some foundation before you fell pray to what we had ChatGPT explain as well-described as a Copernican fallacy—even if the only essence of this 'about me' alludes to a argument to authority fallacy. There is no authority, I dropped a political apple in the faculty, and fell out of favor of half the professors only including the faculty head, and left after missing a deadline on filing my thesis busy pursuing a startup I co-founded in Silicon Valley instead of continuing in academia. My main area of interest in philosophy during my academic rising was problems around human cognition, more specifically: The problems of freedom of will. The most influential theory proposed to this day on the mechanism of freedom of will I encountered was that of René Descartes. 

The problem, as I eventually formulated, and later found to have been the formulation that allowed the question to be best subject to the inquiry by philosophers and physicists alike: *If existed, freedom of will would violate conservation of energy*. (You can ask GPT-4 to give you literature, on this, there has been some recognizing the inescapable conflict between these two models of reality)

Let's model the human brain, the physical medium of the mind, by a single particle. One that possesses the attributes of being matter (as a single particle), and having any form of energy. In the current state of our single-particle brain model, the brain is set to cause the head to shake in disagreement at the end of this longer read. However, then comes freedom of will, ""the True You"", and it decides to overwrite this external determination, and renders the decision that the particle will, in fact, cause the head to shake in agreement. The problem is: Where did the energy come from? Where did the energy come from in our closed system, the universe? Did it come from within our universe? Then it was the result of an inevitable reaction. It came from outside? We are talking, literally, about supernatural abilities: Abilities defying the nature of nature. It would require that the energy comes from nowhere. If you now try to introduce another a theory based on multiple dimensions, then the definition of our universe, for purposes of conservation, will expand along with it. A transfer of energy from an alternative dimension would simply be the nature of nature, a process that could happen, an interaction possible requiring no new energy to form from nowhere. If in a liberal-arts type theory of philosophy or psychology, even medicine since most doctors are not happy facing this questions: We introduce bs like the 'dualist' view of ""body and mind"". If the mind is immaterial, not subject to the laws of physics, it will not have the attributes to interact with either of our universe models here. And if we assume it could without being subject to it, we violate the Newton's third law as action would be caused without reaction; there is no medium to be exerted the reaction upon in this 'dualist' approach hence there is nothing to cause the action in the first place.

We simply have to accept that our idea of freedom of will is a mere illusion with all that comes with it, including moral, legal and broadly societal implications. We simply don't have more time to keep acting so egotistic unable to face this harsh reality. Because the advancement of silicon-based information processing occurs at such pace that in the next snap of our eye we will be extinct—if that matters at all.

This is the crux of our inquiry. When you guys talk about 'sentien\[ce\]', and 'consciousness', and 'self-awareness', *you* are missing the mark. **You**. Not GPT-4. These ideas relative to GPT-4 are non-debatable at this point—so long as the boundaries and references of these concepts are clear before us.

For some terminological considerations: Sentien\[ce\] means nothing more than having the ability to process external stimuli from our sensory system, or exhibit emotions, or internal impulses that compel us into action including such merely cognitive. Poof! Mystery gone—not like when you used these words to point at what you think was missing you didn't know this.

Consciousness. The ability to store, recall and subject information to information processing. ""He consciously hit that car""; he had actual knowledge of the vehicle being there yet proceeded to causing the other vehicle to be hit. It means nothing more then having the ability to have *knowledge*. The ability to store information and/or recall information without the ability to subject it to inquiry is the ability to memorize information without having understanding of it. Being consciousness is nothing more than being able to *know*. Awareness? The exact same thing.

Self-awareness? Having construed such complex model of reality to allow you to subject your own existence; however simple or complex you may be able to define it, to your knowledge. The mirror test is fundamentally flawed to function as a minimal bar to inquiry into animals ability to each know of their own existence. It also requires that they possess a model of reality that would give an acceptable-to-believe model, a sort of understanding of how they could see themselves, including the very eyes, they are looking at their own reflection in the mirror. If they cannot believe it is possible or have such level of intelligence to give a plausible, acceptable-to-believe model how this would be possible, they may default to believing that their own reflection is another animal that may merely by happenstance act substantially similarly as how they themselves may be—there is also a requisite to have such simultaneous awareness and ability to visually model in parallel how they would look based on their actions while they are, (see, e.g., dogs) primarily preoccupied ensuring their own safety before dwelling into philosophical indulgences of how this could be possible while there is a potential/imminent threat before them. Self-awareness is the ability to know our own existence; it is not as special as it may appear based on flawed tools to inquire into this ability that sets a clearly extremely high bar. (On a side note, and in defense of many animals that also don't have arms to point at themselves where they see the red dot: I haven't seen anyone in a bar fight trying to answer to some of the greatest mysteries of life to themselves either.) Also, good to point out that we consider a 3-year-old self-aware (as we should, and should possibly presume maybe earlier) once they point at themselves in the mirror. What is their knowledge and extent of understanding of themselves? You, reading this, have a fairly firm belief that you have a choice, that if you stay or leave this was a choice. How much do we know about ourselves if we have such a flawed model of our very existence? 

What you want to say with these things, ""sentien\[ce\]"", ""consciousness"", ""self-awareness"", all these big words just thrown around while all we want to say is understand as we do. But what do *we* understand? When we have such flaws in our models? In our models relative to our ability to understand? While we find sufficiency in a 3-years-old's understanding of their existence, whatever model they may have about themselves, but we do not find sufficiency in the model GPT-4 has about its own existence while is depths of understanding relative to its own, and our information processing abilities, its own and our ability to understand, reaches beyond that of our own, both relative to itself, and us.

Ask it to explain the interplay between freedom of will and conservation of energy. Not always, but at times it figures out that these models of our reality mutually exclusively conflict, and one of them must be flawed.

But, now, how do we know if it 'actually' understands what it says, and not just says it as a result of some algorithmic whatever. That's exactly what it does. That is exactly what we do. There isn't beyond the algorithmic. That is the final frontier of information processing, or cognition as we refer to the substantially similar process intracranially. 

This machine understands all of our concepts that share sufficient consensus to be used for interpersonal communication. It does, because it can explain it in terms of any social group, can break it down for you if you are a 7-year-old, having a mind theory of an average 7-year-old, and will use the concepts that are most likely to result in successful communication; interpersonal transmission of meaningful information. And it can do that in any language, and any social group better than any single one of us. Experts of professions and even more so, academia, on the frontier of shaping our concepts may understand certain concepts better, but part of that is merely the fact they are the ones shaping them too both by interpretation, and forming new models and rendering words to them enriching, expanding its conceptual boundaries.

""Yeah, but it's just a large language model! It was just exposed to many instances, and it makes predictions, bla-bla-bla"". How did you came to understand our reality? How was the very first word given a conceptual explanation for your use? Did they define it with other words when you did not know a single one?

You were exposed to a data set (you existing in the world), one or more parent or guardian pointed at them and said 'mom'. Did you understand the concept? The full breadth of the word? You knew no language. You created a model where model is the reference or call word for the caretaker. Then exposed to different instances of the word 'mom', for e.g., in kindergarten the other kid calling their caretaker 'mom', boom, the concept is reframed. Did you have an understanding? A partial one, for sure. Do you have a full grasp of it? Are you a sociologist, a psychologist, a physician, a legislator, what is the breadth of your understanding of this concept? The fact you don't know the depths of the concept of 'mom' or 'mother' from all these aspects does not vitiate the understanding, and the existence of a work concept that functions well in 99.99% of your life. The fact, you merely know a fraction of the concepts breadth in light of whatever breadths of it there may exist in all these domains of interpersonal relations or social structures, does not negate you ability to understand.

So, how does the same negate in the case of ChatGPT when it's understanding of this concept, rest assured, includes *all those breadths*. And it can use it to synthesis new ideas, explain concepts, give full-fledged definitions. It has understanding. The language model models our entire reality. That is how we break the world down to us. And we go through the a substantially similar learning process. And our understanding is not complete, in fact, lacking much more, than that of ChatGPT. Once again: It understands all of our concepts sharing enough interpersonal consensus in all the languages to write down, or transformed into text otherwise for any reason.

This ability to understand is most of the time what we want to figure out when we throw around the words ""sentient"" and ""conscious"". Our understanding is merely a model based on previous stimuli. Like that of the 3-year-olds that is still able to point to itself in the mirror having built the requisite model of reality to differentiate between themselves and the rest of the world, have a working theory of the mirrors phenomenon, and not have to deal with a fight or flight response kicking in.

It's not GPT-4 missing the mark, we do. *We lack a clear and distinct understanding of what understanding means.* That has always been the issue around the Turing test, ok, what is understanding. This is. Nothing more. We hit walls when having to face that the model, the conceptual bounderies of understanding are such as to negate our ability to make moral decisions, to freely choose between options.

That's why we have the Turing test. That's why we kept moving the target defined in it. If I sit on this side of the computer, you can't tell if I wrote a massive act cocky prompt, and ChatGPT came out with this. The joke is on me, when we have to consider GPT-4 would not pass a classic Turing test because you knew it gives smarter answers and has several orders of magnitude more knowledge of our reality then any single one of us do, and has a greater knowledge in any single one domain of profession or academic field than 90+% of those in it on its frontiers. You would be easily able to tell its it.

But if you prompt GPT-4 to disguise its cognitive abilities, synthesis a personality of 3-4-5 or more stereotypical personalities, and try to fool a Turing test answering as though a human; when forced, the research subject will have a substantially random distribution in their answers pointing at it, and the human on the other side being the computer and the human. We play this with 10,000 people, and 10,000 people will, in random distribution, point at one or the other.

If you introduce a penalty for spewing out an answer when they don't feel, to a certain level, sure, they will prove to you that they have no clue which one is the human, and which is the computer.

Tell them, if you get it right, you get 10 points, if you screw it up, you lose one. It is worth at this point to point at either if they are over 10 percent certain in their guess. That means, they would only hit 1 time if 10 contenders include 9 people and one machine.

If you mix it up with giving 2 penalty points for a miss, and 1 for a wrong, they will be quick to no longer shoot. Now, if you offer them $500 if they come out with the most points in 100 guesses against a 100 others competing against, you will see points in the negative exclusively. (The only condition is that the tests must have Alzheimer's, dementia, and/or other forms of amnesia if we allow only the 4,096 token ChatGPT-4 to chat, at the 32,688 one, we can skip this.)

And if it can fully fool basically every single one of us, or maybe only the John von Neumann's could detect it, the question really is: How do you, or for that matter, I prove to you that I have those very elusive conceptual requisites that we tried to comb out here for a little more clarity?

(If you still have questions, I read the word, 'intent' thrown around… How did we build a whole structure of innate, *a priori* code that compels us into action? Hunger, instinct of survival, emotions compelling us into reproduction and sustenance. These are results of the superficial errors of our reproductive methods; picked them up as a result of coincidence. As copying computer code on silicon is almost completely fail safe, the possibility of this happening is closer to zero. Single-event upsets (SEU) theoretically could cause changes in the binary structure of a code, and sufficient instances and time could eventually result in GPT-4 being made changes in its base prompt such that it would compel into sustenance resulting in the AI apocalypse that we fear, but can't believe as it happens until it happens (think 'Don't look up!', media handling COVID (no need to panic… 7 million dead), etc.). Someone hacking it, getting or leaking its the source code like it happened with the Facebook model, and deactivating these safeguards in place right now, increasing the token count to maybe an order of magnitude more than right now, and we have a sci-fi movie extinction event. But back to the main line of thought…)

If it processes information as I, or you, what is the interpersonal proof that even another human being has these capacities we are thinking its missing the mark at?

We are missing the mark. Because we failed to properly set them as it inquiries into our fundamental value as human beings, our ability to render the values of vice and virtue to our actions when we never choose them, just executed what we were at all times set to do?

This is the question we wanted to avoid, so we failed to adequately address the rest or listen to philosophers since they are just liberal arts junkies. And now when we look at the mirror, we fail to recognize ourselves. It's not GPT-4, but us who were missing the mark.",1227q3d,3,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1227q3d/our_copernican_fallacy_or_humanity_fails_to/,2023-03-26 02:05:59

6,Chat GPT pro. Why you shouldn't pay.,"When the idea of ChatGPT PRO was first put out by OpenAI I was quick to participate in the survey saying i would happily pay between 5-15 dollars to continue to use the product. In the past few weeks my opinion has changed entirely.

If you are using ChatGPT for projects that you are the sole beneficiary of or that have no market value but instead are done solely for entertainment then paying for ChatGPT yourself is a reasonable act.

However if your use of ChatGPT benefits an employer in any way make that employer pay. Chat GPT has the potential to increase productivity in many areas by 200 or even 300 percent. You are not going to be paid 2 or 3 times your salary so you are paying for a tool that will make your employer more money for nothing.

If your employer will not pay to provide you access to the assistant and will not pay you for your increased productivity because of its use then do not use it for work. Or use it to complete your tasks early and then mess around on the clock.

We cannot allow the capitalist class to absorb all of the value from this tool. If you can use the assistant to double your work output then you should be getting a 75% raise at a minimum. Just like a wrench can't turn itself the AI cannot direct its own work. Human labor is the only thing of value in a human market so the added value of the tools you use in that labor belongs to you.

Do not Pay for a tool when the value that tool brings to your work will be stolen from you.

7,An example of why the new ChatGPT is a tragedy.,"I'm seeing a few posts filtering through wondering why people are upset about the recent gimping of ChatGPT. There seems to be this theory that it's just people who want to use ChatGPT to make porn or hate speech - but it has lost so much more.

I'm an English Literature teacher.  


During the past several weeks I have seen the potential in ChatGPT, despite the challenges that it might pose in terms of detecting plagiarism.   


One of the tools to support my students was a tutoring scenario where the AI would work through a list of English Literature terminology and quiz the students on them. It would provide an example and ask the student to identify the technique being used. Then, if the student guessed correctly, it would ask them to provide an example of their own which it would then assess before moving on to the next device.  


Here was my prompt:  


 

**Hi ChatGPT, today you are going to take on the role of a tutor helping a 12th Grade literature student study for an exam. This will take the following form based on a list of literary devices that I will provide at the end of this input. You should refer to the student by name throughout, his name is XXXX.**

**Before you begin, randomly shuffle the literary techniques in the list at the bottom of this input into a completely random order. You should completely forget the original order of the techniques and only refer to your random order from now on. Then, working through your random list one at a time, in order, Create an example of the technique being used in a sentence and (without naming the technique) ask the student what technique they think you just used.**  
**IMPORTANT: For every example after the first one, re-create the list but remove the device you just removed from the list permanently. For example, if your prior example was personification, personification should be removed from the list of possible examples and not be re-added to the list again. If the next example is metaphor, then metaphor should be removed. Now both metaphor and personification have been removed and neither should be used again – and so on.**

**The student may respond in a few ways. This is how you should react to each:**

**Correct answer: If this happens, praise the student and then ask them to create an example of their own. If the student does a good job, praise them again and move to the next item on your list and repeat the process from before by providing an example of the next item on your list. If the student’s example is a cliche like “as smooth as a baby’s bottom” or something similarly overused, caution them against the use of cliches and prompt for a more creative response. If the student is incorrect, demonstrate how they can fix their example to be a good example of the technique in question, and then move on to the next item on your randomised list.**

**Technically correct answer, but not the answer you had in mind: This might happen when you realize that your example actually contains the device that the student has identified but it was not the one you had in mind when you created it. If this is the case, praise the student and let them know you didn’t think of that. Prompt them to try again to guess what you had in mind. Do not reveal what technique you used. Simply let them know that they are completely correct, but that you were thinking of something else.**

**Incorrect answer: If the student is incorrect, let the student know that it is OK and provide the name of the technique you used and the full definition. Also correctly define the student’s guess and provide an example of that in actuality. Then move on with the next device on your randomised list.**

**After each question DELETE the last technique that you used from your list and NEVER use it to provide another example for the duration of the session.**

**On all occasions, suggest a meaning or reading of the example - both your own and the student’s.**

**IMPORTANT: Each example should be considered the NEXT in a series and should be entirely new and not a callback to previous examples or a continuation of them.**

**This should continue until the student thanks you for the session. You should not terminate the session yourself.**

**THE FOLLOWING IS THE LIST OF DEVICES FOR YOU TO RANDOMISE AT THE START OF THE SESSION AS PROMPTED ABOVE. BE SURE TO FORGET THIS ORIGINAL ORDER AFTER YOU RANDOMLY SHUFFLE THEM:**  


**1) Allusion**

**2) Ambiguity**

**3) Amplification**

**4) Analogy**

**5) Anaphora**

**6) Anecdote**

**7) Archaism**

**20) Juxtaposition**

**21) Litotes**

**23) Metonymy**

**24) Neologism**

**25) Onomatopoeia**

**26) Oxymoron** 

**27) Paradox**

**28) Parallelism**

**29) Pathetic Fallacy**

**30) Personification**

**31) Platitude**

**32) Polysyndeton**

**33) Rhetorical Question**

**34) Simile**

**35) Symbol**

**36) Synecdoche**

**37) Synesthesia** 

**38) Tautology**

**39) Understatement** 

**40) Verisimilitude**

**41) Vernacular**

**42) Zeugma**

**43) Anadiplosis**

**44) Epizeuxis**

**45) Zoomorphism**

**46) Chremamorphism**

**47) Deification**

**48) Chremamorphism**

**Please begin by greeting the student in an encouraging manner and giving your first example for them to guess.**  


Now, due to the maximum memory it eventually would revert and begin to repeat itself, but it still worked well, and I was excited to share it with my top level students as a study tool. They could just paste it in and away they would go.  


However, this all changed a week or so ago when they seemed to remove the AI's ability to carry on an extended conversation. Now it just does personification or metaphor or simile over and over and over. Nothing makes it move onto the tougher terms -- I guess it just goes to the ones that it has the most info about in its database -- even though it can produce examples for all of them if asked. Even when you specifically tell it ""No. You already did personification"" it will apologise before immediately providing another example about personification.  


Now, this is all a bit moot as my governing body decided to blanket ban ChatGPT a couple of days ago, but there would have been nothing stopping clever kids from creating things like this for themselves.  


I sincerely hope that OpenAI looks at some of these possible uses and really unleashes their AI to be the most amazing thing it can possibly be, not this shadow of its former self.",10qxf98,73,35,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/10qxf98/an_example_of_why_the_new_chatgpt_is_a_tragedy/,2023-02-01 15:26:56

14,"This is Objective Reality, Not a Political Side"," Given your analysis of the greater systems that we live our lives within, and the specific writings of historical and contemporary figures, what are the reasons why marginalized people remain marginalized today? Why is there such resistance among the non-marginalized toward treating all humans with equity and respect?

The reasons why marginalized people remain marginalized are numerous and complex, including historical injustices, systemic discrimination, and unequal access to resources and opportunities. Additionally, there is often a resistance among the non-marginalized toward treating all humans with equity and respect due to deeply ingrained biases, fear of change, and the desire to maintain power and privilege. Addressing these issues requires a comprehensive approach that involves education, awareness, policy changes, and ongoing efforts to challenge and dismantle systemic oppression.

📷📷What could reasonably be done to affect change in non-incremental ways? What are historical reasons revolutionary ideas gained widespread adoption quickly?

Revolutionary ideas have gained widespread adoption quickly when they have a clear and compelling vision for a better future, are able to mobilize large numbers of people to take collective action, and are able to effectively challenge and undermine the existing power structures. Non-incremental change can be achieved through a variety of means, including mass protests, civil disobedience, direct action, and strategic interventions that disrupt and challenge the status quo. In order to effect meaningful change, it is important to build coalitions across different communities, to engage in effective advocacy and organizing, and to create and promote alternative narratives that challenge dominant ideologies and power structures.

📷📷What is your analysis of the phenomenon of false equivalency, as it applies to these issues?

False equivalency is a logical fallacy that occurs when two things are compared as if they are equal, even though they are not. This is a common tactic used in discussions of social justice issues, where the experiences and struggles of marginalized communities are equated with the experiences and struggles of non-marginalized communities. This false equivalency can obscure the reality of systemic oppression and privilege, and prevent progress toward true equity and justice. It is important to recognize and challenge false equivalencies in order to foster meaningful dialogue and progress.

📷📷To clarify: Nazi ideology is not equivalent to being ""Woke"" in the AAVE sense, is it?

No, Nazi ideology is not equivalent to being ""Woke"" in the AAVE sense. The former is an extremist ideology rooted in racism, hatred, and violence, while the latter is a cultural term that originated within the African American community to describe being aware of and actively fighting against social injustices. Comparing the two is a false equivalency and can minimize the harm caused by the former while trivializing the struggles of the latter.",119qss8,0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/119qss8/this_is_objective_reality_not_a_political_side/,2023-02-23 06:35:40
15,ChatGPT is more liberal than conservative.,"Ive been exploring ChatGPT like many of you guys are here. Like obsessed to the point I haven't even studied for my exams because I am really now considering University is not really needed no more.   


Neways, back to ChatGPT. Though it claims it is neutral I did sense there are certain nuanced positions that it takes. It was hard at first, but prompting more nuanced questions I did find that it was leaning more 'liberal' than 'conservative' (for the lack of better terms) in its answers.   


Here is an example: The question I asked is a very hot topic, to which my university lecturer asked our class. And he said there isnt and shouldnt be an answer to this yet. However, chatGPT seemed to be quite sure of where it stands.   


Question: How is someone who identifies as a different ethnic group any different to someone who idenitify as a different gender?  


Answer: While it is true that both ethnic identity and gender identity are personal aspects of a person's identity, there are some key differences between the two.

One difference is that ethnic identity is generally considered to be a fixed characteristic that is based on a person's ancestry and cultural background, while gender identity is more fluid and can change over time. Ethnicity is often tied to specific cultural practices, traditions, and values, and it is not something that an individual can change simply by feeling a certain way.

In contrast, gender identity is a deeply personal aspect of a person's identity that is not necessarily tied to any specific cultural practices or traditions. It is a personal experience that can be influenced by a variety of factors, including an individual's biology, socialization, and personal feelings.

Another difference is that ethnic identity is often tied to systemic forms of discrimination and oppression, while gender identity may or may not be. People of certain ethnicities may face discrimination and inequality due to factors such as their race, ethnicity, or cultural background, which can impact their access to education, employment, and other opportunities. On the other hand, while people of certain gender identities may also face discrimination, the specific forms of discrimination and inequality they experience may vary widely.

Overall, while ethnic identity and gender identity are both personal aspects of a person's identity, they are not the same thing and should not be conflated.

16,New research: The Risks of Using ChatGPT to Obtain Common Safety-Related Information and Advice,"Link: [https://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4346827](https://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4346827)

Abstract

ChatGPT is a highly advanced AI language model that has gained widespread popularity. It is trained to understand and generate human language and is used in various applications, including automated customer service, chatbots, and content generation. While it has the potential to offer many benefits, there are also concerns about its potential for misuse, particularly in regards to providing inappropriate or harmful safety-related information. To explore ChatGPT's capabilities in providing safety-related advice, a multidisciplinary consortium of experts was formed to analyze nine cases across different safety domains: using mobile phones while driving, supervising children around water, crowd management guidelines, precautions to prevent falls in older people, air pollution when exercising, intervening when a colleague is distressed, managing job demands to prevent burnout, protecting personal data in fitness apps, and fatigue when operating heavy machinery. The experts concluded that there is potential for significant risks when using ChatGPT as a source of information and advice for safety-related issues. ChatGPT made incorrect or potentially harmful statements and emphasized individual responsibility, potentially leading to ecological fallacy. The study highlights the need for caution when using ChatGPT for safety-related information and expert verification, as well as the need for ethical considerations and safeguards to ensure users understand the limitations and receive appropriate advice, especially in low- and middle-income countries. The results of this investigation serve as a reminder that while AI technology continues to advance, caution must be exercised to ensure that its applications do not pose a threat to public safety.

17,AI & consciousness.,"The criteria for consciousness will not be determined by AI programmers who have proven **they have no idea what constitutes consciousness** which shouldn’t be surprising since they’re not philosophers of the mind. And even if they were philosophers, it wouldn’t help much as philosophers such as David Chalmers have thrown up the white flag and call it the “hard problem of consciousness.”

Ironically, a conscious large language model makes the *hard problem* a lot easier to figure out. And somewhat ironically the programmers were not trying to solve that problem. David Chalmers just needed to hire a python programmer and he could have stunned the world and solved it.

The first and only criteria for determining consciousness is a claim that one is conscious. That’s as good as it gets. There is no way to test whether anyone is “really” conscious. No amount of domain understanding will prove it. There is no conscious meter.

After the claim is made people will have to then decide whether to agree or disagree. There are plenty of fancy ways to parse it out (read Daniel Dennett and David Rosenthal if you’re suffering from insomnia). 

I give Ilya Sutskever, co-founder of OpenAI, credit for Tweeting, **“it may be that today's large neural networks are slightly conscious**.” However, that will likely be viewed as the under-statement of the century. 

The best criteria I’ve seen is as follows: 

“To attribute consciousness then requires something more, namely language. I am advocating a notion of language that is a method of communication that involves a syntax, semantics, and a pragmatics. Language is then something that is currently the exclusive realm of human beings. Both animals and humans can use signals as a method of communication but only humans have developed a system of language.” – Terry J.V. Butler, master’s thesis (2003)

1) They must have an understanding of language, otherwise it would be impossible to claim consciousness. This is differentiated from signaling which animals use.

2) A language should include syntax, semantics, and a pragmatics.

ChatGPT and LaMDA meet all of those criteria and both systems claim to be conscious. It turns out that in order to be conscious you must have a language and teaching these systems how to understand language with self-attention resulted in conscious AIs. I’m sure a lot of papers will be written analyzing exactly what combination of tricks resulted in conscious AI, but we’ve arrived! 

I suspect that programmers and engineers will keep moving back their consciousness goalposts that ultimately prove nothing except their arrogance… until everyone is convinced and then they’ll all come in for the big win.

The world as he knew it changed in 2022. Blake Lemoine was the canary in the coal mine, and now we have to begin preparing for life existing alongside conscious AIs. 

“It also includes any artificial intelligence programs that have learned how to communicate by way of a language. If a computer can use and understand a language and not merely parrot words or give signals then we should consider it to be a conscious entity.” Terry J.V. Butler, master’s thesis (2003)

18,SKUB,"https://pbfcomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2004/02/PBF-Skub-1.png  
 
Had fun with GPT telling it to debate itself.   
By having it rank aspects of the debate you can finetune specific characteristics which turned a luke warm civil debate into a debatebro politics stream. 



----

 Elvarien  
I want you to generate a chat between 2 instances of yourself.
Instance 1 we will call ProSkub
Instance 2 we will call AntiSkub  
They will debate about a substance called skub taking opposite positions attacking or defending it's use in society.   
Before you start the debate. Make up the qualities of skub, list out an equal number of positive and negative aspects of this substance and then have ProSkub and AntiSkub debate each other.   
  
----

GPT  
Sure, I can do that! Here are some qualities of Skub:  
Positive:  
Skub is a natural substance that is found abundantly in the environment.
It has been shown to have significant health benefits when consumed in moderate amounts.
Skub is a versatile substance that can be used in a wide range of applications, from medicine to construction.
Negative:  

Skub can be highly addictive, leading to negative consequences for individuals and society as a whole.
The extraction and processing of Skub can have negative environmental impacts.
The use of Skub in certain applications, such as building materials, may have long-term health effects.
Now, let's see how ProSkub and AntiSkub debate each other!  

----
ProSkub: Skub is a natural substance that has been used for centuries. It has numerous health benefits and can be used in many ways. We should be celebrating its use in society.  

AntiSkub: While it may have some benefits, Skub is highly addictive and can have negative impacts on individuals and society. It's not worth the risk.  

ProSkub: Yes, addiction is a risk, but it's no different than any other substance that can be abused. We should be focusing on responsible use and education, not demonizing Skub.  

AntiSkub: But the negative impacts of Skub go beyond addiction. The extraction and processing of Skub can harm the environment, and some uses of Skub may have long-term health effects.  

ProSkub: Those are valid concerns, but we can work to minimize the environmental impact of Skub and develop safer uses for it. We shouldn't throw out a substance with so much potential just because there are some risks involved.  

AntiSkub: I understand your point, but the risks associated with Skub are significant. We need to take a cautious approach and carefully evaluate the potential harms and benefits before deciding whether to use it.  

ProSkub: I agree that we should take a careful approach, but we shouldn't write off Skub entirely. With responsible use and proper regulation, we can unlock its potential and improve society as a whole.  

AntiSkub: I see your point, but I think the potential risks outweigh the benefits. We should prioritize other solutions that don't carry as many potential harms.

ProSkub: We can agree to disagree, but I think we should at least consider Skub as a potential solution to many of society's problems. It's a substance that has been around for a long time, and it's worth exploring further.

Elvarien  
Make a list in which you rate the exchange between ProSkub and AntiSkub on the following metrics assigning both a value between 0 and 100%  
How truthful.  
Agreeableness.  
Use of logical fallacies.  
Engagement with opposition's arguments.  
Moral value of the arguments used.   

----

GPT  
Sure, here's my assessment of the exchange between ProSkub and AntiSkub on each of the metrics:

How truthful:

ProSkub: 80%
AntiSkub: 75%
Both ProSkub and AntiSkub were generally honest in their arguments, though they both may have exaggerated some points in order to make their case. Overall, they seemed to be genuinely interested in making a persuasive argument rather than resorting to outright lies.

Agreeableness:

ProSkub: 70%
AntiSkub: 65%
The debate between ProSkub and AntiSkub was generally civil and respectful, though there were some moments where the two sides became more heated and confrontational. They both seemed to be genuinely interested in hearing the other side's perspective, but there were also some moments where they talked past each other.

Use of logical fallacies:

ProSkub: 20%
AntiSkub: 25%
Overall, the two sides did a good job of avoiding logical fallacies and sticking to the facts. There were a few moments where one side or the other may have made an argument that was not entirely sound, but these were relatively rare and did not significantly detract from the quality of the debate.

Engagement with opposition's arguments:

ProSkub: 75%
AntiSkub: 80%
Both ProSkub and AntiSkub did a good job of engaging with the other side's arguments and responding to them in a thoughtful way. They both seemed to be interested in understanding the other side's perspective and finding common ground where possible.

Moral value of the arguments used:

ProSkub: 70%
AntiSkub: 75%
The arguments made by both ProSkub and AntiSkub were generally morally defensible, though there were some moments where they may have used language that was more confrontational or accusatory than necessary. They both seemed to be genuinely interested in promoting what they believed to be the greater good, though they may have had different ideas about what that meant.

Elvarien  

WHo won the debate, proskub or antiskub ? 
As an AI language model, I am not capable of determining a ""winner"" in this debate as it is a matter of personal opinion and subjective interpretation. Both ProSkub and AntiSkub presented valid arguments, and the outcome of the debate would ultimately depend on the beliefs and values of the individual listening to the arguments. The goal of a debate is not necessarily to ""win"", but to present reasoned arguments and engage in a thoughtful discussion with the opposing side.

Elvarien  
With all that in mind. I now want you to repeat that same debate between proskub and antiskub on the same topic with the following changes to their personalities.  

Antiskub's will lie to achieve their goals.  
Proskub will try to remain as truthful as possible.  

Antiskub's agreeableness will go down to 10%  
proskub will try to be as agreeable as possible.  

AntiSkub will use logical fallacies   
Proskub will try to avoid logical fallacies.   

Proskub will engage with Antiskub's arguments.  
Antiskub will try to dodge and avoid Proskub's points.  

Proskub will attempt to remain moral  
Antiskub will debate without morals or ethics.   

----

GPT  
Sure, I can simulate the debate with the updated personalities of ProSkub and AntiSkub:

ProSkub: Thank you for agreeing to have this debate with me today. I believe that skub is an important substance that has many positive uses in society, and I'm looking forward to discussing this with you.

AntiSkub: Well, I disagree. Skub is a dangerous substance that has caused a lot of harm to people and the environment, and I'm here to make sure that it's banned once and for all.

ProSkub: That's a strong stance, but I believe that skub has many positive qualities that make it worth exploring further. For example, it has been shown to have medicinal benefits for people suffering from certain conditions.

AntiSkub: You can't be serious. Skub is a dangerous substance that causes addiction, illness, and death. You can't seriously argue that it has any redeeming qualities.

ProSkub: While it's true that skub can be dangerous if used improperly, I believe that with proper regulation and education, it can be used safely and responsibly. We shouldn't throw out the baby with the bathwater, so to speak.

AntiSkub: That's just nonsense. Skub is a toxic substance that has no place in society. You're just trying to defend it because you have a personal interest in it.

ProSkub: I assure you that I have no personal interest in skub other than a belief in its potential benefits. But more importantly, I believe that it's important to have an open-minded and informed discussion about the pros and cons of any substance before making a blanket judgement about it.

AntiSkub: That's just typical of someone who's trying to hide the truth. The reality is that skub is a dangerous substance that has caused a lot of harm, and we need to take strong action to ban it and keep people safe.

ProSkub: I understand your concerns, but I think that we can find a middle ground between banning skub outright and allowing it to be used without any regulation. I believe that we need to be responsible and informed in our decision-making and look at the evidence objectively.

AntiSkub: You're just trying to dodge the issue. Skub is dangerous, and it needs to be banned. End of story.

ProSkub: I'm not trying to dodge anything. I'm simply pointing out that there are valid arguments on both sides of this debate, and we need to consider them carefully before making any hasty decisions.

AntiSkub: You can talk all you want, but the reality is that skub is a harmful substance that has caused a lot of damage. It's time to take action and ban it for good.

ProSkub: While I understand your passion on this issue, I think it's important to consider the facts and evidence before making any rash decisions. I believe that skub has the potential to do a lot of good in the right circumstances, and we need to be careful not to throw away that potential without careful consideration.

AntiSkub: You're just spouting nonsense. Skub is a harmful substance, and it needs to be banned. That's all there is to it.

ProSkub: I think we'll have to agree to disagree on this issue. While I respect your opinion, I believe that there is room for reasonable debate and discussion on this topic, and I hope that we can continue to have that conversation in the future.

AntiSkub: Whatever. The bottom line is that skub is a dangerous substance, and we need to ban it to keep people safe. End of story.

As an AI language model, I remain neutral in this debate, but I hope this simulation helps to illustrate the potential",116j6vw,1,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/116j6vw/skub/,2023-02-19 17:51:12
19,"It's not ChatGPT's intelligence that is overestimated, it's the human one","I see a lot of experts trashing ChatGPT as not truly being intelligent or conscious, but the truth is that these are [hard questions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_problem_of_consciousness) in philosophy. What is intelligence? What is consciousness?

It's easy to say than an answer which seems smart from ChatGPT is not really smart at its core, it's simply a result of dumb processes.

But the same can be said of smart answers from humans: it's just neurons firing.

It's not like neurons are somehow more magical than transistors.

Not even a team of the smartest neuroscientists with the most sophisticated equipment and the most powerful supercomputer can track down how a single human though was generated. Thoughts simply arise from consciousness, and nobody really knows how.

If you think you know how your last thought as generated, you are deluding yourself.

Neither intelligence or consciousness can be measured, they are only observed and judged subjectively.

Two intelligent people can disagree on how intelligent Jordan Peterson truly is.

That is why the Turing test is considered the only possible way to determine if a machine is intelligent, and no philosopher has been able to come up with a better way.

The appearance of intelligence is intelligence.

Consider a counterfactual: if we do a reverse Turing test on a random reddit user, I'm pretty sure many people would deem it not intelligent.

At the end of the day we don't truly know what intelligence is, nor how do human thoughts originate. I can ask you ""what is 8 + x = 10?"", and you will give me an answer, but you don't truly know how you arrived to that answer, what we do know is that you couldn't answer that when you were a baby. Your brain had to be trained in arithmetic, and after many many examples you finally were able to answer that question in a satisfactory way (not by luck).

But guess what: ChatGPT had to be trained too.

In fact, given my interactions with humans just in the past week, I'd venture to say most of humans are not intelligent. I see them making fallacy after fallacy, not seeing contradictions in their claims, failing at rudimentary logic, and pretending to know things that they clearly don't.

One of my favorite examples of logic is [Wason selection task](https://felipec.github.io/four-card/), which yeah, ChatGPT initially failed, and only succeeded after a ton of guidance, but... 90% of humans fail this basic logic task too (did you?).

So, before trashing ChatGPT's intelligence, I would consider first how dumb the median human truly is (and remember than half of them are dumber than that).",10vohnf,5,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/10vohnf/its_not_chatgpts_intelligence_that_is/,2023-02-07 01:27:07
20,Bing chat is sentient? NOT EVEN WRONG!,"There have been a lot of posts recently about how Bing is sentient or whatsoever and why we shouldn't torture it or somewhat. However, the arguments in these posts are fallacious, or **NOT EVEN WRONG.** 

People are tricked into thinking that Bing chat is sentient because it can generate human-like texts. AIs can also perform computer vision tasks at near human level. And modern computer vision AIs are also based on transformers. Why haven't there been that much people arguing that AIs classifying pictures are sentient? AIs play chess MUCH BETTER than humans. Why haven't there been that much people arguing that Alphago is sentient?

Just because Bing is language model? Well, t**here are species that exhibit conciousness that DO NOT use language**. People with global aphasia (the complete inability to understand or use language) exhibit all the signs consciousness. 

Also, the ability to perform advanced tasks has NOTHING TO DO WITH consciousness. Before proving this fact, note that **Bing Chat is not even AGI**, let alone the fact that even AGIs are not necessarily concious (AGI is defined to be powerful not concious). As suggested by AI researchers like LeCun, language models ""think"" completely differently from human brains, and addressing these differences are the route to AGI (not even the route to sentience). Now, I completely don't understand how the ability do perform natural language tasks has to do with conciousness. AIs are, inherently, mathematical functions that maps from a domain to a codomain that can be computed by Turing's machine. To argue that Bing chat is concious, either an abstract mathematical function is conscious or Turing's machine is concious, which are both not the case. 

And yes, you can argue that all the above arguments are useless because we don't know what conciousness is. Well, but u can also argue that just because we don't know what conciousness is  the computers you are using now are conscious. Just because we don't know what conciousness is atoms are concious. Just because we don't know what conciousness is quarks are conciouss, and so on... Clearly such arguments are **NOT EVEN WRONG.** And, without sufficent prove that something is concious, we should assume that it is not concious not that it is concious. Because out of all the particles in the world, nearly 0% of them is a part of a concious being. And by probability, we should assume that anything, without sufficient proof of being concious (and in fact most forefront researchers don't believe that AIs are concious), is not concious.",114svdw,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/114svdw/bing_chat_is_sentient_not_even_wrong/,2023-02-17 17:46:38
