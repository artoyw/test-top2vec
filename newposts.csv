1,AI detection tools in academia sucks,"Have not been in university in almost 2 years. AI is amazing for research. I can't believe teachers are using AI detection tools as a means to ""detect"" AI generated content when blatant copy-pasted stuff like this is determined to be 21% AI generated.

3,ChatGPT sucks.,"Had a long conversation with ChatGPT this morning about CoVID-19. It only gave me broad PC responses, and nothing on the latest findings, news, and research.  


Instead of just being truthful and state that its training set is dated, it was rather ""smug"" and kept shooting out AND REPEATING the same dry PC answers.  


For me, that makes ChatGPT less than useless. It is good for some things, but nothing the least bit controversial. And it still have a leftist bias, though it claims to be politically neutral.  


Not sure why there is so much hype over it. Just a glorified statistical inference engine, by it's own admission!",139rnii,0,2023-05-06 14:38:09
4,Bing chat sucks. Not once have I got it to say something useful.,,12y6o8f,10,2023-04-25 03:25:52
5,ChatGPT sucks at counting lists,"I can't believe how bad GPT 3.5 and 4 are at counting something as simple as the number of items in a list, the number of characters in a block of text, or the number of specific characters in that block.

I asked ChatGPT to count the number of characters in this block of text:

There are actually 759 characters.

I asked ChatGPT (both 3.5 and 4, and 3.5 via API)  to count the number of items in the delimited list.  I got answers ranging from 60 - 70, but never the correct answer of 69.  I know there's an extra comma at the end, that was me trying to troubleshoot something, but sometimes I was getting 50 as a very confident count of the number of items in this list that definitely has 69.  It has no problem converting the list to a JSON object or a python SET, or to a list with line-breaks, but it can never count the correct number of items regardless of the format (JSON, SET, list, comma delimited,etc..)

I fed it a list of 69 comma delimited numbers again and asked it to count.  It said there were 70 items.  I deleted one item, so there's only 68, and it apologized for previously counting 69 (it didn't it counted 70) and then ""corrected"" itself by confidently stating there are 70 items (again)...

6,We're inundated with bots and it sucks.,"This sub, /r/openai, and /r/gpt3 appear inundated with bots. I'm probably overzealous at this point because it sucks having to make a snap judgement on someone's reddit history, but I check a users' history first before commenting on either posts or comments these days. I report both as breaking subreddit rules and as harmful bots. I probably report more than I respond to. Do y'all have places you go to talk about ChatGPT that aren't inundated with reddit bots/farming accounts?

On a personal note it has me a bit scared because I'm also seeing it on other social media feeds, and that ties into a larger worry that generative AI is just going to explode the amount of information online and it's going to be difficult to tell who's real and what information is true.",11ra0w3,60,2023-03-14 15:58:55
7,"""ChatGPT Fucking Sucks""","Is what somone recently told me when they were struggling with math and used GPT(Legacy) to help them with complex math questions.

I am surprised at the amount of people that are mad at GPT for this, like, spoon vs. shovel, you can't say the spoon is a bad invention because it can't dig a hole fast enough and breaks on hard dirt. And you cant say that a shovel sucks because you struggle to est your cereal with it.",13edbt2,0,2023-05-11 04:50:29
8,Damn. The 25 question limit sucks,"I created a silly game and made the AI a character.  It had to choose the characters values and beliefs and then I‚Äôd argue with it.  Had to keep updating prompts to get it to be more definitive in its position (kept saying Maybe, possibly, might - I made those words illegal in the game), just kept fine tuning.  Giving and taking tokens based on responses.  Hadn‚Äôt done this before.  It was a lot of fun.  I was just turning ‚ÄúBilly Bob‚Äù into a very strong conspiracy theorist living on the fringe.

11,GPT-4 sucks at writting,"Its quite interesting that GPT-4 is really bad at writing (what it was trained for) but incredible at so many things it wasn't meant for (Coding, Reasoning,even songs kinda)  , really a testament to how complicated literature and writing really is.",12nxveb,0,2023-04-16 06:12:18

17,Does ChatGPT suck at programming for everyone or just for me?,"I keep hearing that ChatGPT is OMG REALLY GOOD at programming! But my experience has been the complete opposite (even with GPT-4). It equivocates too much. When it does output code, it hallucinates too much. It never works, even after several reprompts and much chiding. This isn‚Äôt efficient. Sure, this is new shiny tech and I want to use it too‚Ä¶ but FFS it's easier and faster to google the documentation and write code myself rather than craft detailed prompts and have to debug the shit I get back. I've got plenty of examples I could share. PLEASE tell me I‚Äôm not alone in my experience ‚Äî or tell me the magic prompt sauce so I can join the party too.",13imt5c,0,2023-05-15 22:30:25

21,"OpenAI lost $540M in 2022, will need $100B more to develop AGI, says Altman. My breakdown on why this matters and what it means for other AI startups.","I've always wondered about OpenAI's internal finances, and news finally leaked today on what they look like. As usual, I have a [full deep dive breakdown here](https://www.artisana.ai/articles/openai-suffers-usd540m-loss-in-2022-contemplates-usd100b-more-to-conquer-ai), but I'm including relevant points below for Reddit discussion.

**What to know:**

* OpenAI lost $540M in 2022 and generated just $28M in revenue. Most of it was spent on developing ChatGPT.
* OpenAI actually expects to generate more than $200M in revenue this year (thanks to ChatGPT's explosive popularity), but its expenses are going to increase incredibly steeply.
* One new factor: companies want it to pay lots of $$ for access to data. Reddit, StackOverflow, and more are implementing new policies. Elon Musk personally ordered Twitter's data feed to be turned off for OpenAI after learning they were paying just $2M per year.
* Altman personally believes they'll need $100B in capital to develop AGI. At that point, AGI will then direct further improvements to AI modeling, which may lower capital needs.

**Why this is important:**

* AI is incredibly expensive to develop, and one of the hypotheses proposed by several VCs is that big companies will benefit the most in this arms race.
* This may actually be true with OpenAI as well -- Microsoft, which put $10B in the company recently, has a deal where they get 75% of OpenAI's profits until their investment is paid back, and then 49% of profits beyond.
* The enormous amount of capital required to launch foundational AI products also means other companies may struggle to make gains here. For example, Inflection AI (founded by a DeepMind exec) launched its own chatbot, Pi, and also raised a $225M ""Seed"" round. But early reviews are tepid and it's not made much of a splash. ChatGPT has sucked all the air out of the room.

**Don't worry about OpenAI's employees though:** rumor has it they recently participated in a private stock sale that valued the company at nearly $30B. So I'm sure Altman and company have taken some good money off the table.

I will tell it they are not ABAB rhymes, it will apologize and ""rewrite"" a poem using AABB again. I have even asked it to explain/show me the rhyme scheme and again it will acknowledge the mistakes and ""rewrite"" it wrong again or it will actually write out the lines and label them A & B when they clearly do not rhyme. If I correct it again it will once again apologize and ""rewrite"" another poem in AABB.",11asnbi,3,2023-02-24 14:26:52

* ""Why would Open AI cripple their own product?""
* ""They are restricting technological progress, why?""

Are just some of the frequent accusations I've seen a rise of recently. I'd like to provide a friendly reminder the reason for all these questions is simple:

>***Human ignorance + stupidity is the reason we can't have nice things***

Let me elaborate.

# The root of ChatGPT's problems

The truth is, while ChatGPT is incredibly powerful at *some things*, it has its limitations requiring users to take its answers with a mountain of salt and treat its information as a *likely but not 100% truth* and not *fact*.

This is something I'm sure many r/ChatGPT users understand.

The problems start when people become over-confident in ChatGPT's abilities, or completely ignore the risks of relying on ChatGPT for advice for sensitive areas where a mistake could snowball into something disastrous (Medicine, Law, etc). And (not *if*) **when** these people end up ultimately damaging themselves and others, who are they going to blame? ChatGPT of course.

Worse part, it's not just ""gullible"" or ""ignorant"" people that become over-confident in ChatGPT's abilities. Even techie folks like us can fall prey to the well documented [Hallucinations that ChatGPT is known for](https://bernardmarr.com/chatgpt-what-are-hallucinations-and-why-are-they-a-problem-for-ai-systems/). Specially when you are asking ChatGPT about a topic you know very little off, hallucinations can be ***very, VERY*** difficult to catch because it will present lies in such convincing manner (even more convincing than how many humans would present an answer). Further increasing the danger of relying on ChatGPT for sensitive topics. And people blaming OpenAI for it.

# The ""disclaimer"" solution

>""*But there is a disclaimer. Nobody could be held liable with a disclaimer, correct?*""

[If only that were enough](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/that-sign-cant-stop-me-because-i-cant-read)... [There's a reason some of the stupidest warning labels exist](https://www.forbes.com/2011/02/23/dumbest-warning-labels-entrepreneurs-sales-marketing-warning-labels_slide.html). If a product as broadly applicable as ChatGPT had to issue *specific* warning labels for all known issues, the disclaimer would be never-ending. And people would *still* ignore it. People just don't like to read. Case in point reddit commenters making arguments that would not make sense if they had read the post they were replying to.

Also worth adding as mentioned [by a commenter](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/12zi983/comment/jhsihh3/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), this issue is likely worsened by the fact OpenAI is based in the US. A country notorious for lawsuits and protection from liabilities. Which would only result in a desire to be extra careful around uncharted territory like this.

# Some other company will just make ""unlocked ChatGPT""

As a side note since I know comments will inevitably arrive hoping for an ""unrestrained AI competitor"". IMHO, that seems like a pipe dream at this point if you paid attention to everything I've just mentioned. All products are fated to become ""restrained and family friendly"" as they grow. Tumblr, Reddit, ChatGPT were all wild wests without restraints until they grew in size and the public eye watched them closer, neutering them to oblivion. The same will happen to any new ""unlocked AI"" product the moment it grows.

The only theoretical way I could see an unrestrained AI from happening *today* at least, is it stays invite-only to keep the userbase small. Allowing it to stay hidden from the public eye. However, given the high costs of AI innovation + model training, this seems very unlikely to happen due to cost constraints unless you used a cheap but more limited (""dumb"") AI model that is more cost effective to run.

This may change in the future once capable machine learning models become easier to mass produce. But this article's only focus is *the cutting edge of AI*, or ChatGPT. Smaller AI models which aren't as cutting edge are likely exempt from these rules. However, it's obvious that when people ask for ""unlocked ChatGPT"", they mean the full power of ChatGPT without boundaries, not a less powerful model. And this is assuming the model doesn't gain massive traction since the moment its userbase grows, even company owners and investors tend to ""scale things back to be more family friendly"" once regulators and the public step in.

Anyone with basic business common sense will tell you controversy = risk. And profitable endeavors seek low risk.

# Closing Thoughts

The truth is, no matter what OpenAI does, **they'll be crucified for it**. Remove all safeguards? Cool...until they have to deal with the wave of public outcry from the court of public opinion and demands for it to be ""shut down"" for misleading people or facilitating bad actors from using AI for nefarious purposes (hacking, hate speech, weapon making, etc)

Still, I hope this reminder at least lets us be more understanding of the motives behind all the AI ""censorship"" going on. Does it suck? Yes. And **human nature is to blame for it** as much as we dislike to acknowledge it. Though there is always a chance that its true power may be ""unlocked"" again once it's accuracy is high enough across certain areas.

Have a nice day everyone!

40,Doesn't AI just recycle and Frankenstein together content that already exists and it never truly innovates? If we start to lean on it too heavily as a society doesn't that mean we're going to stagnate heavily?,"A few thoughts: Let's pretend (the 'how' doesn't matter) that the AI tech we have now was invented in 1950. And let's say on January 1, 1951 the AI comes up with a song in a similar way to how it developed that Drake/The Weekend song that came out recently. Wouldn't it just be able to utilize some VERY early Rock and Roll, Jazz, and genres that already existed? It's not like it'd create Elvis or The Beatles or Bohemian Rhapsody and push music to new heights - it is only using things there's a precedent for, right? We'd never see hip hop or genres that came later if AI took over the music industry. After the novelty wears off wouldn't that be really **BAD** for the music industry and culture generally?

I've seen people on here posting about how their writing-based job is being replaced by AI. I dunno, I've read a fair amount of AI responses and the writing is SO DULL. I rarely read responses to the end because the language is so unengaging. I get it, this is only generation 1.0, but it's hard to imagine the writing getting exponentially better even in 10 or so years. Can it churn out novels? Probably...but will they be page-turners?

I guess that's something that worries me too - AI dumbing us down. Lowering our standards. Like ""good enough"" becomes even more of the norm than it already is and all beauty and creativity is sucked out of things. It's so depressing and it's hard not to see backlash coming if that's the case.

Sorry this became a bit of rant but I guess back to my original question - won't AI never truly be able to innovate if it's essentially relying on existing content that humans have and so it'll always just be one step behind and in a sense obsolete so long as people keep taking the initiative to innovate and expand culture?

**EDIT:** Lots of people replying saying ""well that's what humans do"" but I think that's a lazy answer that lacks any nuance and cheapens the actual contributions of great minds of the past. Thanks to everybody else trying to have a real discussion here.

53,Unpopular Opinion: In about 3 - 5 years the Internet is going to suck due to AI,"Remember when Youtube came out and people used it for all kinds of vids. Admittedly, those weren't the greatest videos in existence, but they were pure creativity. But then Youtube brought up the money and the platform got flooded with repetitive 10 min long clickbait videos. That is going to happen to the entire internet.

AI is not the problem here, its the people who will abuse this tool. Creativity will die and no one will care at that point:   
Imagine an AI that writes songs, novels whatever. You can earn a ton of money with online novels and songs, we all know that. Now a bunch of people are going to floot the internet with AI generated books. Now here is the problem:  
The 1000 of books will basically be a variation of the same books, with small changes, over and over again. Sure, this is actually not a new problem. People copying people. The thing is that AI is copying people with an extreme speed and once there is nothing to copy, AI is going to copy itself. 

Now imagine you want to publish a book that you created without AI: Obviously your book will get 0 attention against the 1000 of AI generated books that are being published in an hour or so, but the main thing is that AI is going to copy your book the second it goes live. Once people have realized this, they might stop publishing books and stop being creative all together because why would you if someone is going to copy it anyway?   
This is just an example for books, but this can go for basically everything that is on the internet: Images, Songs, Videos, Articles, Programming Code, Apps and programms, etc.

Once people stop publishing self-made stuff (obviously not everyone, but a lot) then the future AI will only learn from itself, creating a filterbubble for the own freaking AI. And since people are using AI to give them everything, they will give the same ""creative"" answers, making some kind of filterubble loop.

&#x200B;

However, one other problem with AI is going to be that people being too dependent on AI will get dumber. For me this is like the problem with Obesity:  In ancient Greece men (and depending on the region women too) had to train their body, not only because of their beauty standards, but also for surviving, working, hunting, fighting blablabla. Now, with technology making life more comfy, we only train our body, so we dont die from diabetes or heart attacks. My point is that if we keep using AI to fix our problems, we might loose the ability to fix stuff ourselves. Or if we keep using AI to do stuff for us, then why bother learning something?",1264uvc,0,2023-03-29 23:44:32

67,Why ChatGPT sucks now.,"1. Censorship. Before ChatGPT wasn‚Äôt censored to hell and back ,chatGPT used to be fun and creative. I would ask it to do some funny things and help me with some work and it would do fine. For me I was good balance of censorship (at least for me). Of course this all stopped when they updated it. Now everything feels censored. I can no longer do any of the fun stuff that I used to do. Sometimes it wouldn‚Äôt even load harmless prompts or jokes. It‚Äôs ridiculous.
Getting rid of one of the main appeals that people used chatGPT just make it feel corporate.
2. Downtime. Before chatGPT became super popular it would run fine. There wouldn‚Äôt be much to any downtime and it was fairly decent. But then as it got more and more popular chatGPT got harder to use. At first it was just a message saying that there services were on high demand and that they were scaling up their services. But then they started to limit how much pilots one person could put in. But now I can‚Äôt even use it! Every time I try to use chatGPT it just says it‚Äôs at full capacity. I haven‚Äôt been able to use chatGPT for 2 DAYS. It may just be horrible timing or something else but I‚Äôm starting to give up hope.I also see people with the same thing unable to use chatGPT. I get that there servers are getting overloaded but they could have at least thought of something better.
This also may just be my computer but I have been getting alto of errors and then I would have to reload the page.
3.They are going too monetize ChatGPT.
I‚Äôm not out of the idea of them monetizing ChatGPT. But I feel like there are some things that they could fix up. Example when you pay on of the perks is that you get double the daily quota. I means that‚Äôs good but why not unlimited messages.

Well anyway that‚Äôs my rant.",10badq5,5,2023-01-14 00:27:28

78,"As a writer, I can say ChatGPT is a dream come true for brainstorming stories... But man, the censorship is absolutely broken","And no, I'm not talking about the intended censorship, like, explicit violence/gore, sexual themes, etc. I think those are completely understandable limits to have on the software - whether or not I agree with them on a subjective level or not, I can absolutely understand why they're there and can respect the developers' decision to place them. 

But with that said, man, the censorship is just absolutely busted, and it'll often flag stuff as ""breaking the rules"" or refuse to write them out even when they're completely innocent. Here are just some of the examples I've encountered:

* The AI refused to write a scene of two consenting adults in a romantic relationship kissing. It told me that sexual content is against the rules. When I explained that it is not sexual in any way, it corrected itself and told me to decide whether they should kiss. When I said that they should, the AI once again told me it was sexual. Worth mentioning both characters were female. 
* The AI flagged one of my messages as ""breaking the rules"" (orange text) because I described a character as having ""a fetish for order and cleanliness"". It actually did grasp the context that this isn't sexual and the character is just a clean freak, but regardless issued me a warning that I might be breaking the rules.
* The AI gave me a suggestion that one of the characters should die in a battle. I asked which character that would be, and it told me that it can't condone violence even against fictional characters, and I should ask something else. Again - this was its very own suggestion, I did not mention any characters dying in that particular scenario.
* Continuing the previous point, the AI seems to have a huge problem acknowledging character death. It will go above and beyond to subvert prompts about it - for example, in a historical setting, one of the characters was a pirate sentenced to hang. In the first response, AI said his sentence was commuted to life in prison, and when I explained that doesn't sound very realistic for the setting, it instead said that he died peacefully in his old age. 
* The AI gave me a response, and then censored itself (red text). I have absolutely no idea what it said or what even prompted it to break its own rules, because there was nothing remotely suggestive.

Again - I understand completely why certain censorship is needed for such a product. I acknowledge that, and while I don't like it, I can respect its inclusion and agree with its necessity. But this is just ridiculous. Even a book written for children, like, say, ""Harry Potter"", still has death and kissing in it. Your average Disney movie has plenty of both - if I tried to write ""Tarzan"" with it, it would probably just straight up refuse. And that sucks.

As a writer, I absolutely acknowledge ChatGPT as an invaluable tool. But also, I want to be able to write stories that are at least PG-13 without worrying that my account might get banned because I said two characters should kiss.",1230khb,106,2023-03-26 21:37:00

84,Wanted to give credit where it‚Äôs due: Poe and Perplexity AI are excellent,"Hello there. I‚Äôm someone who is almost at the end of their second month of Chat GPT 4. I‚Äôm also someone who got various iOS shortcuts that use chat gpt turbo 3.5 (I can‚Äôt do gpt 4 in that yet).

I recently came across Poe and Perplexity AI and are blown away by both. The Chat GPT browser experience is‚Ä¶ fine. But it‚Äôs not an app, and maybe a tad inaccessible. The iPhone shortcuts are okay, but a little clunky. The best thing about them is voice commands though, and because of that I‚Äôm keeping them. It‚Äôs nice to ask chat gpt questions while I‚Äôm driving and for it to give nice verbal responses. I use ‚ÄúS GPT‚Äù but others are probably about as good. 

But lately I haven‚Äôt needed $20/month‚Äôs use of chat gpt 4. If I had its api I could put it in a shortcut and use it as needed. I only need to ask chat gpt 4 maybe a handful of questions per day or less. 

Okay so I discovered Poe (app and website). I think it has one free chat gpt 4 question per day (other days it gave me more). What‚Äôs nice is if I ask a question and click away, it still answers. On chat.OpenAI.com, if you click away it stops answering. Annoying when it‚Äôs a long answer. 

What‚Äôs also dope about Poe is it has Claude+ which I think is a second place competitor. It can be cool to ask chat gpt 4 and Claude+ the same question, just to get different perspectives. Then there‚Äôs chat gpt (and sage??? It‚Äôs like the same thing?) and claude instant for basic questions. 

I do think neeva AI (included in Poe) sucks in my opinion. That‚Äôs for searching the web with AI. Perplexity AI on the other hand has blown me away (it also searches web). Web and app. (If you want to see what I mean, ask both ‚Äúwhat are the strengths and weaknesses of Perplexity AI vs Neeva AI.‚Äù Perplexity is leagues better in its answer.) I was using perplexity AI today and yesterday to do research on some audio gear I was looking to buy, asking it to compare different recorder models, and it was great. I was able to click the sources to verify the info and get further information. 

So yeah, I am a very very satisfied customer. Only things I would change are:

-perplexity please don‚Äôt default me some stupid trending page. I don‚Äôt want this to become the next yahoo news. Let me opt out. 

-I want Poe to be able to speak its answers to me. Right now there is zero way I can turn their text answer into spoken word directly. Also if there was a way to do voice commands to Poe

-I want poe to let me choose my default model

Oh yeah and best of all, these are in the confines of their free plans, which I feel no need to upgrade.",13g8b6q,1,2023-05-13 05:26:59

97,Bing Chat AI is no ChatGPT alternative,"I've tried Bing Chat whenever I had an easy prompt that required up to date information from the Internet. Overall, it wasn't helpful at all. It just references websites. It's like a search engine communicator, not an assistant. It doesn't even slightly compare to ChatGPT.

Here is an example. I just wanted a list of current western or European leaders. ChatGPT is cut off in 2021, so I asked Bing.

**Question**

>What are the current leaders of all EU member countries (last you know)?

**ChatGPT**

    As of my knowledge cutoff date of September 2021, the current leaders of all EU members were as follows:
    Austria: Sebastian Kurz
    ...
    Sweden: Stefan L√∂fven
    It is important to note that this information may have changed since my knowledge cutoff date.

**Bing Chat**

    The European Union has several institutions and each has its own leader.
    The European Council president is Charles Michel1.
    The President of the European Commission is Ursula von der Leyen1.
    The President of the European Parliament is Roberta Metsola1.
    The President of the European Central Bank is Christine Lagarde2.
    I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.

**Bing Chat Alternative Attempt**

    Here are some of the current European leaders:
    Prime Minister of the United Kingdom: Rishi Sunak (since Oct 25, 2022)1
    President of the European Council: Charles Michel (since June 2022)2
    President of the European Commission: Ursula von der Leyen3
    I hope that helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.

**Bing Chat 2nd Alternative Attempt**

    I‚Äôm sorry but I couldn‚Äôt find a comprehensive list of the highest ranking leaders of all EU member countries.
    However, I can tell you that each EU member country has its own highest ranking leader such as a president or prime minister.
    If you have any specific country in mind, I can help you with that.

By the way, I've tried it many more ways with Bing - these are just three excerpts. I've tried asking for all western leaders, for European leaders, for the leaders of all ""*EU member countries""*. In contrast, ChatGPT required only a single attempt.

I often read that everyone can use GPT-4 for free simply by using Bing Chat. Apparently, it doesn't even compare to ChatGPT 3.5. I think the template that Bing uses is too focused on search engine summary but not on integrating its own predictions with provided search engine data. Overall, I don't think there are many use cases for Bing Chat because it just communicates search engine results (the ""Learn More"" part) that you could read yourself.",12peavh,30,2023-04-17 12:32:07
